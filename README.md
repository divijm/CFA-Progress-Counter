# CFA Progress Counter

## Project Name

Progress Counter and Progress Counter Temperature

## Description

Create an application that counts the progress of how many questions have been asked. E.g If the user has answered 4 questions out of a total of 10 questions, the application would display 4/10 to help identify the user of their progress.

An extension to the application, was for it to be able to collect weather inputs from the user and then put that data together in a table which shows the temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
